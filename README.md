# POTATO-LEAF-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION

The model uses a unique convolutional neural network to detect early blight and late blight potato infections and identifies Healthy leaf as well  from leaf images after extracting potato leaves from plant images using image segmentation.
Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
Data Augmentation is a process that generates several realistic variants of each training sample, to artificially expand the size of the training dataset.
This aids in the reduction of overfitting.
In data augmentation, we will slightly shift, rotate, and resize each image in the training set by different percentages, and then add all of the resulting photos to the training set. 
This allows the model to be more forgiving of changes in the objectâ€™s orientation, position, and size in the image. The contrast and lighting settings of the photographs can be changed. 
The images can be flipped horizontally and vertically. We may expand the size of our training set by merging all of the modifications.
